# How the Tutorials Work
As you likely noticed from the previous lesson, when a code example is provided it will be on the right half of the window. In general, each lesson will have a complete example of the code that corresponds to the lesson's descriptive contents. Although you can copy and paste this, it is recommended that you read and type the code for better understanding. You should also run `go build` and run the corresponding executable to experience what has changed in the code.

Many lessons will provide a description of the changes made using a **diff**, or difference, view. The removal of a line is signified as:

```
- this line has been removed.
```

And the addition of a line is signified as:

```
+ this line has been added.
```

Often these will be used to show what parts of the code have changed so as to provide a clearer description of what has changed.

For example, if we start with the following:

```
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  i++
}
```

A diff of changes could be presented as:

```

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
-  i++
+  i = i * 2
}
```

And with this description of how the tutorials will work, we can delve into Part 1!
