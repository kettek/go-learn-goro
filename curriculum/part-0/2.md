# Editors
The choice of how you edit Go is ultimately up to you, however an excellent editor for Go is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Simply install VS Code and acquire the following extensions:

  * **Go** by Microsoft
  * **Go Outliner** by 766b

After installing these, you will likely be prompted to install additional tools via a dialog box located on the bottom-right of VS Code. Accept these prompts so all the needed tools are set up accordingly.

Once everything is set up, you can run and build your Go source through the built-in Terminal accessible via the `Ctrl-\`` shortcut.
