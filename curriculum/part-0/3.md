# Testing Go
To ensure everything is working fine, create a file titled `main.go` in a new directory.

Place the contents of the code to the right in this file.

Once you have done this, open a terminal in your project directory and type `go build`. After this, run your application by typing in `./main` or `main.exe`. You should see the following output:

```
Hello, Rogue!
```
