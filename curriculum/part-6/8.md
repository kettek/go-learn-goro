# Updating Main!

## Code Analysis
```
-		player := entity.NewEntity(0, 0, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorWhite}, "Player", entity.BlockMovement)
+		player := entity.NewPlayerEntity()

		entities := []interfaces.Entity{
			player,
		}
```
Here we simply adjust our player creation call to use `entity.NewPlayerEntity()`.

```
			// Handle events.
			switch event := screen.WaitEvent().(type) {
// . . .
			}

			// Handle entity updates.
			if gameState == NPCTurnState {
-				for i, e := range entities {
-					if i > 0 {
-						fmt.Printf("The %s punders.\n", e.Name())
-					}
+				for _, e := range entities {
+					if e.Actor() != nil {
+						e.Actor().TakeTurn(fovMap, gameMap, entities)
+					}
				}
				gameState = PlayerTurnState
			}

// . . .
```
Here we adjust our entities turn loop to call the entity's actor's `TakeTurn(...)` method if the entity indeed has an Actor.

## Topics Covered
We have now updated our main code to use our new actor code!

At this point you can build your project and see the results of your work! Monsters will now chase you and stare you down when close enough -- at least if they're in your field of view!
