# Create the Actor Interface
Now we must create the Actor interface that we will (eventually) use for handling AI.

Create a new file in your **interfaces** package directory titled **actor.go**.

## Code Analysis
```
+package interfaces
+
+import (
+	"github.com/kettek/goro/fov"
+)
+
```
Here we have our standard package definition and import section. We are importing goro's fov package here as we will be using it in an Actor method.

---
```
+type Actor interface {
+	Owner() Entity
+	SetOwner(Entity)
+	Target() Entity
+	SetTarget(Entity)
+	TakeTurn(fov.Map, GameMap, []Entity)
+}
```
Now we define our Actor interface. As can be seen, we have `Owner()` and `SetOwner(Entity)`. These are used to get and set the relationship with the owning Entity. We also have `Target()` and `SetTarget(Entity)`. These will be used to get and set an entity target of the Actor, such as for monster chasing. Finally, we have `TakeTurn(...)`. This method will be called when the Entity is supposed to take an action such as moving or attacking another Entity.

## Topics Covered
We've covered the creation of our Actor interface that we will implement shortly.

## What's Next
Up next is implementing the Fighter Interface.
