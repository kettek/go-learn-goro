# Updating the Entity struct
Now we will update our Entity implementation to match the interface.

## Code Analysis
```
import (
+  "math"
  "myproject/interfaces"

  "github.com/kettek/goro"
)
```
Here we are adding the `math` library for use in our DistanceTo method.

---

```
// Entity is a type that represents an active entity, such as a player or monster, in the game map.
type Entity struct {
	x, y    int
	rune    rune
	style   goro.Style
	name    string
	flags   uint
+	fighter interfaces.Fighter
+	actor   interfaces.Actor
}
```
Here we are adding a Fighter and Actor interface to our Entity's struct.

---

```
// Move moves the entity by a given amount.
func (e *Entity) Move(x, y int) {
	e.x += x
	e.y += y
}
+
+// DistanceTo gets the distance between two entities.
+func (e *Entity) DistanceTo(other interfaces.Entity) float64 {
+	destX := float64(e.x - other.X())
+	destY := float64(e.y - other.Y())
+
+	return math.Sqrt(math.Pow(destX, 2) + math.Pow(destY, 2))
+}
```
Now we implement our DistanceTo method. This method returns the distance between two entities as a floating point number. This will later be used for our monster Actor logic.

---

```
// SetFlags sets the entity's flags.
func (e *Entity) SetFlags(f uint) {
	e.flags = f
}
+
+// Actor gets the Actor interface owned by the entity.
+func (e *Entity) Actor() interfaces.Actor {
+	return e.actor
+}
+
+// SetActor sets the entity's Actor to the passed one.
+func (e *Entity) SetActor(a interfaces.Actor) {
+	e.actor = a
+	e.actor.SetOwner(e)
+}
+
+// Fighter gets the Fighter interface owned by the entity.
+func (e *Entity) Fighter() interfaces.Fighter {
+	return e.fighter
+}
+
+// SetFighter sets the entity's Fighter to the passed one.
+func (e *Entity) SetFighter(f interfaces.Fighter) {
+	e.fighter = f
+	e.fighter.SetOwner(e)
+}
```
Here we are implementing the Actor and Fighter getters and setters. Note that both the SetFighter and SetActor methods also call `SetOwner(e)` on the Actor/Fighter. This is so we properly set up a bi-directional relationship between the Entity and the Actor/Fighter so it can access the Entity interface.

## Topics Covered
Here we have added a basic distance method and setters/getters for both Actor and Fighter.

## What's Next
Next we will implement the Actor interface.
