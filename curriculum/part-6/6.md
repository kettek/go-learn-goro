# Entity Factories
We will now create a new file called **factory.go** inside our **entity** package. This file will be responsible for creating our specific entity types and set up their relationships with their actor and fighter interfaces.

## Code Analysis
```
+package entity
+
+import (
+ "myproject/interfaces"
+
+	"github.com/kettek/goro"
+)
```
Here we define our package line and our imports.

---
```
+func NewPlayerEntity() interfaces.Entity {
+	pc := &Entity{
+		rune: '@',
+		name: "Player",
+		style: goro.Style{
+			Foreground: goro.ColorWhite,
+		},
+		flags: BlockMovement,
+	}
+	return pc
+}
```
We now define the `NewPlayerEntity()` function. This simply sets up an Entity structure with the desired defaults for the player and then returns an Entity interface.

---
```
+func NewMonsterEntity(x, y int, r rune, style goro.Style, name string) interfaces.Entity {
+	c := &Entity{
+		x:     x,
+		y:     y,
+		rune:  r,
+		name:  name,
+		style: style,
+		flags: BlockMovement,
+	}
+	c.SetActor(&MonsterActor{})
+
+	return c
+}
```
Now we define the `NewMonsterEntity(...)` function. This works much as the `NewPlayerEntity()` function but takes in x, y, rune, style, and a name as arguments. After creating the Entity structure, we then call `SetActor(...)` with a newly created `MonsterActor` instance. We then return this Entity as an Entity interface.

## Topics Covered
Here we have implemented some factory functions to make the generation of Entities far cleaner than writing the same code inline.

## What's Next
Next up we will update our **mapping/gamemap.go** file to use our `NewMonsterEntity()` function.
