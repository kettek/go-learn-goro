# Updating the Entity Interface
We are now going to update our Entity Interface to provide getters and setters for two new interface types: **Actor** and **Fighter**. The Actor interface will be used to provide the Entity with a form of AI and the Fighter interface will be used to manage health, damage, and other combat-related interactions.

Open your **interfaces/entity.go** file.

## Code Analysis
```
type Entity interface {
	Move(x, y int)
+	DistanceTo(other Entity) float64
	// Basic property accessors
	X() int
	SetX(int)
	Y() int
	SetY(int)
	Rune() rune
	SetRune(rune)
	Style() goro.Style
	SetStyle(goro.Style)
	Name() string
	SetName(string)
	Flags() int
	SetFlags(int)
+	// Actor and Fighter accessors
+	Actor() Actor
+	SetActor(Actor)
+	Fighter() Fighter
+	SetFighter(Fighter)
}
```

Here we are just adding new accessors for the yet-to-be-defined Actor and Fighter interfaces as well as a DistanceTo method that will be used by the AI.

## Topics Covered
Not much at all!

## What's Next
Next we will update the Entity implementation to match the new accessors.
