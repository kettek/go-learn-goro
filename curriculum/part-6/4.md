# Creating the Fighter Interface
Now we will create the Fighter interface. This will be used to manage hit points, defense, and otherwise. Create a new file in **interfaces** called **fighter.go**.

## Code Analysis
```
package interfaces

type Fighter interface {
	Owner() Entity
	SetOwner(Entity)
}
```
Here we are defining our basic Fighter interface. We will revisit this later, so at the moment it simply defines an Owner and SetOwner method.

## Topics Covered
Just the definition of a barebones interface.

## What's Next
Up next is creating an Actor implementation that will be used to control monster logic.
