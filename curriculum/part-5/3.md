# Implementing Entity Generation
We now return to **mapping/gamemap.go** to implement entity generation.

## Code Analysis
```
// MakeMap creates a new randomized map. This is built according to the passed arguments.
-func (g *GameMap) MakeMap(maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize int, player *entity.Entity) {
+func (g *GameMap) MakeMap(maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize int, entities *[]*entity.Entity, maxMonsters int) {
	var rooms []*Rect

	for r := 0; r < maxRooms; r++ {
		// . . .
		// Add the room if there is no intersection found.
		if !intersects {
			g.CreateRoom(room)
			roomCenterX, roomCenterY := room.Center()

			// Always place the player in the center of the first room.
			if len(rooms) == 0 {
-				player.X = roomCenterX
-				player.Y = roomCenterY
+				(*entities)[0].X = roomCenterX
+				(*entities)[0].Y = roomCenterY
```
We have replaced the `MakeMap(...)` function signature with one that takes a pointer to a slice of Entity pointers as well as a maxMonsters integer. We have removed the player argument as the player will exist within the `entities` argument as the first index.

Further on we have replaced our `player.X` and `player.Y` assignments with `(*entities)[0].X` and `(*entities)[0].Y`. This changes the entity at index 0 within the dereferenced `entities` slice to whatever we provide.

---
```
			} else {
				prevCenterX, prevCenterY := rooms[len(rooms)-1].Center()

				// Flip a coin if we should tunnel horizontally or vertically first.
				if goro.Random.Intn(1) == 1 {
					g.CreateHTunnel(prevCenterX, roomCenterX, prevCenterY)
					g.CreateVTunnel(prevCenterY, roomCenterY, roomCenterX)
				} else {
					g.CreateVTunnel(prevCenterY, roomCenterY, prevCenterX)
					g.CreateHTunnel(prevCenterX, roomCenterX, roomCenterY)
				}
			}

		if !intersects {
			// . . .
+			// Place random monsters in the room.
+			g.PlaceEntities(room, entities, maxMonsters)
			// Append our new room to our rooms list.
			rooms = append(rooms, room)
		}
	}
}
```
We then continue on to add a call to a yet-to-be-defined `PlaceEntities(...)` method. This method will be used to place random monsters within a given room. Note that I have replaced some code with `// . . .` so as to improve brevity.

---
```
// CreateVTunnel creates a vertical tunnel from y1 to/from y2 starting at x.
func (g *GameMap) CreateVTunnel(y1, y2, x int) {
	// . . .
}

+// PlaceEntities places 0 to maxMonsters monster entities in the provided room.
+func (g *GameMap) PlaceEntities(room *Rect, entities *[]*entity.Entity, maxMonsters int) {
```
Here we are defining our new PlaceEntities function. This will place up to a given amount of monsters with a room, updating the provided entities as it does so. Note the type used for `entities`. We are using a pointer to a slice of entity.Entity pointers. This allows us to resize the entities slice within the function.

---
```
+	monstersCount := goro.Random.Intn(maxMonsters)
+
+	for i := 0; i < monstersCount; i++ {
+		var monster *entity.Entity
+		// Acquire a random location within the room.
+		x := (1 + room.X1) + goro.Random.Intn(room.X2-room.X1-1)
+		y := (1 + room.Y1) + goro.Random.Intn(room.Y2-room.Y1-1)
+
```
Now we are generating a random number from zero to maxMonsters to represent the amount of monsters to place within the room.

We then loop from zero to this number and generate a random x and y value from the room's top-left floor tile to the room's bottomm-right floor tile. Note that we neegate our room's X2 from X1 and Y2 from Y1 so that we can properly randomize up to the width and height of the room.

---
```
+		if entity.FindEntityAtLocation(*entities, x, y, 0, 0) == nil {
```
Here we are using our `FindEntityAtLocation(...)` function to find any entity that exists at the provided coordinates. We use 0 for both the checkMask and the matchFlags so that we match against any possible entity, regardless of its flags.

---
```
+			// Generate an orc with 80% probability or a troll with 20%.
+			if goro.Random.Intn(100) < 80 {
+				monster = entity.NewEntity(x, y, 'o', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorLime}, "Orc", entity.BlockMovement)
+			} else {
+				monster = entity.NewEntity(x, y, 'T', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorGreen}, "Troll", entity.BlockMovement)
+			}
```
Now we generate a random number between 0 and 100. If the number is less than 80, then we create an orc enemy. If the number is greater, then we create a troll.

---
```
+			*entities = append(*entities, monster)
+		}
+	}
+}
```
And now we add our monster to our entities slice. Note that we are dereferencing the entities list here so that we can change the slice that is pointed to. This allows the caller of our `PlaceEntities(...)` function to have the entities slice it provided be changed.

## Topics Covered
We have implemented randomized entity generation that avoids placing any entities atop another.

## What's Next
Now we can return to our `main.go` file to actually generate our monsters!
