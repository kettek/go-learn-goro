# Creating Entity Flags
To begin with, we are going create a new file called **entity/flags.go**. This file will store the definitions and constants for special flags that will be used to control blocking movement and otherwise.

## Code Analysis
```
package entity

// Flags represents multiple states stored as in a bitflag.
type Flags = int
```
Here we have our package line followed by a new type called Flags that is an integer. This will be our data type for storing multiple flags within a single variable.

---
```
// Our entity flags.
const (
	BlockMovement Flags = 1 << iota
)
```
Here we define the flags that may be set within the Flags type. At the moment we just have a single flag but this can be later expanded.

Note our `1 << iota` declaration. This shifts uses iota to bitshift once for each enumeration of our const block. This effectively means that BlockMovement is equal to the bits value of `00000001`. If we added another flag it would be `00000010`, and the next would be `00000100` and so on.

Using this will allow us to do filtering to match particular flag values.

## Topics Covered
Here we have implemented a basic `entity.Flags` type that will be used to define properties on an Entity.

## What's Next
Now we will move on to using our `entity.Flags` type within our `Entity` type.
