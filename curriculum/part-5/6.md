# Taking Turns
Now we will return to our **main.go** file and add our game state functionality

## Code Analysis
```
		// Our initial variables.
		mapWidth, mapHeight := screen.Size()
		maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize := 30, 6, 10
		maxMonstersPerRoom := 3
+		gameState := PlayerTurnState
```
Here we are defining our gameState variable and assigning it to the player's turn. We will use this variable to control whose turn it is.

```
			// Handle events.
			switch event := screen.WaitEvent().(type) {
			case goro.EventKey:
				switch action := handleKeyEvent(event).(type) {
				case ActionMove:
+					if gameState == PlayerTurnState {
						x := player.X + action.X
						y := player.Y + action.Y
						if !gameMap.IsBlocked(x, y) {
							otherEntity := entity.FindEntityAtLocation(entities, x, y, entity.BlockMovement, entity.BlockMovement)
							if otherEntity != nil {
								fmt.Printf("You lick the %s in the shins, much to its enjoyment!\n", otherEntity.Name)
							} else {
								player.Move(action.X, action.Y)
								fovRecompute = true
							}
						}
+						gameState = NPCTurnState
+					}
				case ActionQuit:
					goro.Quit()
				}
			case goro.EventQuit:
				return
			}

```
Now we have simply wrapped our player movement code within a check to ensure the gameState is set to the player's turn. If so, we move accordingly and thereafter set the gameState to be the npc's turn.

---
```
			// Handle events.
			// . . .
+
+			// Handle entity updates.
+			if gameState == NPCTurnState {
+				for i, e := range entities {
+					if i > 0 {
+						fmt.Printf("The %s punders.\n", e.Name)
+					}
+				}
+				gameState = PlayerTurnState
+			}
```
Here we have added entity updating code after our own handling code. Here we iterate through our entities, skipping the first entity, which is our player, and printing a string to the console indicating our entity's action. After iterating through the entities, we set the gameState back to the player's turn.

## Topics Covered
We have implemented a very basic state system to control turns.

## What's Next
With this we have finished part 5 of this tutorial. In the next part we will implement inflicting damage and taking damage!
