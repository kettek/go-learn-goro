# Modifying main (yet again)
Now we return to our **main.go** file so as to implement our monster generation.

# Code Analysis
```
		// Our initial variables.
		mapWidth, mapHeight := screen.Size()
		maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize := 30, 6, 10
+		maxMonstersPerRoom := 3
```
Here we have added a new maxMonstersPerRoom variable that will, as the variable name indicates, be used to limit the amount of monsters that can spawn in a room.

```
-		player := entity.NewEntity(screen.Columns/2, screen.Rows/2, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorWhite})
-		npc := entity.NewEntity(screen.Columns/2-5, screen.Rows/2, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorYellow})
+		player := entity.NewEntity(0, 0, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorWhite}, "Player", entity.BlockMovement)

		entities := []interfaces.Entity{
			player,
-			npc,
		}

```
Here we are removing our npc variable and adjusting our player's NewEntity call so as to provide a name and the proper BlockMovement flag.

We no longer need the npc variable due to the fact that we will be randomly generating monsters.

```
		gameMap.Initialize()

-		gameMap.MakeMap(maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize, player)
+		gameMap.MakeMap(maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize, &entities, maxMonstersPerRoom)
```
Now we have adjusted our `MakeMap(...)` call to provide a pointer to our entities slice along with our maxMonstersPerRoom variable.

```
			// Handle events.
			switch event := screen.WaitEvent().(type) {
			case goro.EventKey:
				switch action := handleKeyEvent(event).(type) {
				case ActionMove:
-					if !gameMap.IsBlocked(player.X()+action.X, player.Y()+action.Y) {
-						player.Move(action.X, action.Y)
-						fovRecompute = true
+					x := player.X() + action.X
+					y := player.Y() + action.Y
+					if !gameMap.IsBlocked(x, y) {
+						otherEntity := entity.FindEntityAtLocation(entities, x, y, entity.BlockMovement, entity.BlockMovement)
+						if otherEntity != nil {
+							fmt.Printf("You lick the %s in the shins, much to its enjoyment!\n", otherEntity.Name())
+						} else {
+							player.Move(action.X, action.Y)
+							fovRecompute = true
+						}
					}
```
Here we have removed our old simple movement code and replaced it with one that takes into account other entities.

We begin by storing our desired x and y position with the *x* and *y* variables. We then first check if our game map is not blocked, and if not, then we check if an entity exists at the target location that blocks movement. If another entity is found, then we simply print a message to the console indicating that our movement was blocked. If no entity was found, then we move our player in the desired direction.

If you build the game now, you should be able to move around your dungeon and "interact" with randomly generated orcs and trolls!

## Topics Covered
We have covered blocking our player with other entities and reacting accordingly.

## What's Next
With this implemented, we can add a simple game state mechanism to allow our player and monsters to take turns.
