# Game State
We will be creating a new file in the project root called `gamestate.go`. This will contain our GameState type and some predefined GameState constants.

## Code Analysis
```
+package main
+
+// GameState is a numerical representation of a game state.
+type GameState = uint8
+
+// Our various game states.
+const (
+	PlayerTurnState GameState = iota
+	NPCTurnState
+)
```
Here we are adding our `GameState` type that we will use to control if it is the player's turn or the npc's turn.

## Topics Covered
Simple GameState types and constants!

## What's Next
A return to main to allow the NPCs to act!
