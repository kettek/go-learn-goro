# Drawing the Player
This section will be quite short and will consist of drawing the player symbol at a particular location on the screen.

As per usual, we will only be addressing changes in our code.

## Code Analysis

```
     screen.SetTitle("My Roguelike")

+    // Our initial variables.
+    playerX, playerY := screen.Columns/2, screen.Rows/2
```
`playerX` and `playerY` are our player positions set to the center of our screen's dimensions.

---

```
      // Draw screen.
-     screen.DrawString(0, 0, fmt.Sprintf("Press any key to Quit."), goro.Style{})
+     screen.DrawRune(playerX, playerY, '@', goro.Style{})
+     screen.Flush()
```
As can be seen, we've replaced the `DrawString` call with a `DrawRune` call. `DrawRune` functions in a similar way to `DrawString` but only draws a single rune to the screen.

## Topics Covered
With this lesson, we've merely added a couple variables that we use to render the player to a specific location.

## What's Next
We can now move on to handling keypress events and moving the player's position accordingly.
