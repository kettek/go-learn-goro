# Converting Events to Actions
We can now convert our received `goro.EventKey` objects into our own `Action` objects. To do this, we will create a separate file named **eventHandling.go** and place the code to the right inside of it.

## Code Analysis
```
package main
```
Here we have our regular package statement.

---
```
import (
	"github.com/kettek/goro"
)
```
We must also import the goro library here so our code can refer to goro's various Key constants.

---
```
// handleKeyEvent converts a KeyEvent into a corresponding Action.
func handleKeyEvent(ev goro.EventKey) Action {
	switch ev.Key {
```
Here we have a `switch statement` that handles the different values that `ev.Key` may have.

---
```
	case goro.KeyUp:
		return ActionMove{Y: -1}
	case goro.KeyDown:
		return ActionMove{Y: 1}
	case goro.KeyRight:
		return ActionMove{X: 1}
	case goro.KeyLeft:
		return ActionMove{X: -1}
```
Now we handle particular key presses and return `ActionMove`s that should correspond to those keypresses.

---
```
	case goro.KeyEscape:
		return ActionQuit{}
```
Here we handle the escape key and return an `ActionQuit` type.

---
```
	}
	return nil
}
```
Finally, we close our switch and return nil if a key has not been handled. Remember that `return` always stops processing and returns to where the function was called from.

In the future this, and the actions file, will provide the ability to do other actions besides movement, such as opening an inventory, firing a wand, or otherwise!

## Topics Covered
We've convered the basic conversion of events to actions.

## What's Next
Now we can move onto joining this lesson and the previous one into *actually* moving the player around the screen.
