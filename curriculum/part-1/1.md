# Initializing Going Rogue
Let us begin by creating a new project. To do this, create a new directory titled `MyProject` and create a file called `main.go` within it. This file will host your main program code and the contents should match the window to the right.

Additionally, since we are using the **Going Rogue**/**goRo** package, we will have to issue the command `go mod init MyProject` within your project directory. This is to allow for the use the what are known as go modules, which **goRo** is.

We will now go through the provided code so we can understand what exactly is going on.

## Code Analysis

```
+package main
```

This first line determines the name of the package our roguelike game will be stored under.

```
+import (
+  "github.com/kettek/goro"
+  "log"
+)
```

These lines define the libraries we will be importing for use. The first is the Going Rogue library and the second is Go's log library.

```
+func main() {
```

This is our main function that will contain the start of our program logic.

```
+	// Initialize goro!
+	if err := goro.InitTCell(); err != nil {
+		log.Fatal(err)
+	}
```

These lines cause Going Rogue to initialize the "TCell" backend and to fatally log an error if it fails. The program will stop running if an error occurs here. You may, at your wish, use `InitEbiten()` instead of `InitTCell()` to use a graphical window rather than a console/terminal based one.

```
+  // Quit goro!
+  goro.Quit()
+}
```
`goro.Quit` causes the Going Rogue to clean up and exit.

### Topics Covered
What we have covered here is the basic steps for initializing the libraries for your roguelike.

### What's Next
We can now move on to creating our game logic loop.
