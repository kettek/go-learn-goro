# Handling Actions
We will now be creating an abstraction layer for handling Actions. These will correspond to actions such as moving the player or quitting the game.

To begin with, create a file titled **action.go** in your project's directory and place the code to the right within it.

## Code Analysis
```
package main

```
Here is our usual package declaration.

---
```
// Action is our base interface for game actions.
type Action interface{}
```
`Action` is an [interface](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9) that we will be using to pass around the concrete types defined below.

---
```
// ActionMove is our action for moving something.
type ActionMove struct {
	X int
	Y int
}
```
`ActionMove` is an implementation of our Action interface that can store two values: An X value and a Y value. We will later use this to move our player around the screen.

---
```
// ActionQuit is our action to quit the program.
type ActionQuit struct{}
```
`ActionQuit` is another implementation of our Action interface that will be used to signal the program to exit.

## Topics Covered
Here we have created our basic Action interface and a few implementations of it.

## What's Next
Now we can move on to converting `goro.EventKey`s to `Action`s.
