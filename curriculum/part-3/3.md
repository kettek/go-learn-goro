# From Rect to Room
Now we will enhance our GameMap type to be capable of creating rooms and effectively digging them out from the map.

## Code Analysis
```
// Initialize initializes a GameMap's Tiles to match its Width and Height.
func (g *GameMap) Initialize() {
  . . .
}

+// CreateRoom creates a room from a provided rect.
+func (g *GameMap) CreateRoom(r *Rect) {
+  for x := r.X1 + 1; x < r.X2; x++ {
+    for y := r.Y1 + 1; y < r.Y2; y++ {
+      g.Tiles[x][y] = Tile{}
+    }
+  }
+}
```
Here we are adding a new method for creating a room from a provided rect. All this does is iterate through all the Tiles from X1,Y1 to X2,Y2 and set them to be non-blocking.

```
// Initialize initializes a GameMap's Tiles to match its Width and Height.
func (g *GameMap) Initialize() {
  . . .
}
+
+// MakeMap populates our GameMap with rooms.
+func (g *GameMap) MakeMap() {
+	room1 := NewRect(20, 15, 10, 15)
+	room2 := NewRect(35, 15, 10, 15)
+
+	g.CreateRoom(room1)
+	g.CreateRoom(room2)
+}

// CreateRoom creates a room from a provided rect.
```
Here we are creating our `MakeMap(...)` method that will, in its current state, create two `Rect`s and use them with the `CreateRoom(...)` method.

## Topics Covered
We have now adjusted our GameMap to be capable of digging out rooms using our Rect type.

## What's Next
Now we must return to our main code to make a minor adjust to use this new system.
