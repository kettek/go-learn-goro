# From Rect to Room
Now we will enhance our GameMap type to be capable of creating rooms and effectively digging them out from the map.

## Code Analysis
Please note that we are not adding code linearly here but rather we are adding according to its logical precedence. For example, we first add `CreateRoom(...)` but then add `MakeMap()` _above_ it, in terms of where it sits in the code. This is due to a potentially(?) good habit of having functions that are used in higher functions be placed lower than the functions in which they are used.

```
// NewGameMap initializes a GameMap's tiles to match the provided width and height and sets up a few tiles to block movement and sight. Returns a GameMap interface.
func NewGameMap(width, height int) interfaces.GameMap {
  . . .
}

+// CreateRoom creates a room from a provided rect.
+func (g *GameMap) CreateRoom(r Rect) {
+  for x := r.X1 + 1; x < r.X2; x++ {
+    for y := r.Y1 + 1; y < r.Y2; y++ {
+      if g.InBounds(x, y) {
+        g.tiles[x][y] = Tile{}
+      }
+    }
+  }
+}
```
Here we are adding a new method for creating a room from a provided rect. All this does is iterate through all the Tiles from X1,Y1 to X2,Y2 and set them to be non-blocking if they are within the map's bounds. We are not explicitly setting the `Flags` properties of the Tile but rather assigning `g.Tiles[x][y]` to the value of a default Tile. This is due to the fact that within go all data structures are zero-initialized. `Flags`, therefore, is assigned to a value of 0.

// NewGameMap initializes a GameMap's tiles to match the provided width and height and sets up a few tiles to block movement and sight. Returns a GameMap interface.
func NewGameMap(width, height int) interfaces.GameMap {
  . . .
}
+
+// MakeMap populates our GameMap with rooms.
+func (g *GameMap) MakeMap() {
+	room1 := NewRect(20, 15, 10, 15)
+	room2 := NewRect(35, 15, 10, 15)
+
+	g.CreateRoom(room1)
+	g.CreateRoom(room2)
+}

// CreateRoom creates a room from a provided rect.
```
Here we are creating our `MakeMap(...)` method that will, in its current state, create two `Rect`s and use them with the `CreateRoom(...)` method.

## Topics Covered
We have now adjusted our GameMap to be capable of digging out rooms using our Rect type.

## What's Next
Now we must return to our main code to make a minor adjust to use this new system.
