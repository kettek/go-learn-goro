# Mapping: Rect
We will now create a new type that will be used for digging out rooms. In your **mapping** sub-directory, create a new file called **rect.go**. 

## Code Analysis

```
+package mapping
+
```
Here we have our standard package declaration.

---
```
+// Rect is a helper type to represent a rectangular area.
+type Rect struct {
+	X1, Y1, X2, Y2 int
+}
```
Here we have our actual Rect type. This type simply contains coordinates for a region, from X1, Y1 to X2, Y2.

---
```
+// NewRect returns a new Rect type with its properties calculated.
+func NewRect(x int, y int, w int, h int) Rect {
+	return Rect{
+		X1: x,
+		Y1: y,
+		X2: x + w,
+		Y2: y + h,
+	}
+}
```
This is a helper function to create a pointer to a Rect that has its X1, Y1, X2, Y2 properties populated from the passed in x, y, width, and height parameters.

---
```
+// Center returns the center of the Rect.
+func (r *Rect) Center() (x, y int) {
+	return (r.X1 + r.X2) / 2, (r.Y1 + r.Y2) / 2
+}
```
This method allows us to get the center coordinates of the Rect. We will later use this to tunnel between rooms and place the player.

---
```
+// Intersect returns a bool representing if the Rect intersects with another.
+func (r *Rect) Intersect(other Rect) bool {
+	if r.X1 <= other.X2 && r.X2 >= other.X1 && r.Y1 <= other.Y2 && r.Y2 >= other.Y1 {
+		return true
+	}
+	return false
+}
```
This method will be used to ensure that Rects do not overlap during map generation.

## Topics Covered
We have creates a new Rect type along with some methods that will be useful during actual map generation.

## What's Next
Now we can return to our GameMap type and put code in place to actually use our new Rect type.
