# Adjusting Main for Great Justice
Now we have the **monumental** task of adjusting our main file so as to properly call our new `GameMap` methods.

## Code Analysis

```
		// Screen configuration.
		screen.SetTitle("My Roguelike")
+
+		// Randomize our seed so the map is randomized per run.
+		goro.SetSeed(goro.RandomSeed())

		// Our initial variables.
```
We have added a call to `goro.SetSeed(...)` along with `goro.RandomSeed()` so as to provide a fully randomized dungeon each time we run our game. If we did not include this line, or set the seed to a value such as `1`, then the map would remain the same every run.

---
```
		// Our initial variables.
		mapWidth, mapHeight := 80, 24
+		maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize := 30, 6, 10
```
Here we are adding our variables for randomized generation.

---
```
		gameMap := mapping.NewGameMap(mapWidth, mapHeight)

-		gameMap.MakeMap()

```
We are removing our `gameMap.MakeMap()` call here as we must place it _after_ our entities setup due to the new MakeMap using the player Entity.

---
```
		entities := []interfaces.Entity{
			player,
			npc,
		}
+
+		gameMap.MakeMap(maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize, player)

		for {
```
Here we have placed our new `MakeMap(...)` method.

With this in place, rebuild your project and run it. You should see a randomized dungeon map!

## Topics Covered
We've enhanced our main file to use the new `MakeMap(...)` method and we have set up proper seed randomization so our dungeon is unique every time it is built.

## What's Next
Coming up next is creating a field of view so we can actually explore our dungeon with a modicum of mystery!
