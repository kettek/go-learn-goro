# Setting Up for Digging
We are now going to make a slight adjustment to our **mapping/gamemap.go** file and specifically adjusting the default state of all Tiles in a GameMap.

## Code Analysis

```
	for x := range g.Tiles {
		g.Tiles[x] = make([]Tile, g.Height)
+		for y := range g.Tiles[x] {
+			g.Tiles[x][y] = Tile{
+				BlockSight:    true,
+				BlockMovement: true,
+			}
+		}
	}
-
-	g.Tiles[30][22] = Tile{
-		BlockMovement: true,
-		BlockSight:    true,
-	}
-	g.Tiles[31][22] = Tile{
-		BlockMovement: true,
-		BlockSight:    true,
-	}
-	g.Tiles[32][22] = Tile{
-		BlockMovement: true,
-		BlockSight:    true,
-	}

```
What we have done here is remove the manual testing tile state and replaced it with a for loop that iterates through all tiles and sets them to be blocked. This means that we will be digging rooms out of our map rather than placing them on it.

## Topics Covered
Here we have simply adjusted our GameMap's default tile state to be always blocking.

## What's Next
Now we can move on to creating a type that will aid in digging out rooms.
