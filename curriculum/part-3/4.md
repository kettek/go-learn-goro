# Adjusting Main
Now we must lightly adjust our **main.go** file to use our enhancements to `GameMap`.

## Code Analysis
```
		gameMap.Initialize()
+
+		gameMap.MakeMap()

		player := entity.NewEntity(screen.Columns/2, screen.Rows/2, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorWhite})
```
Here we add a line to call our `gameMap`'s `MakeMap()` method.

Build and run your program and you should see two unconnected rooms!

## Topics Covered
Not much to be honest.

## What's Next
Although it is cool having a couple rooms, think of how much cooler it would be to actually connect our rooms! That exciting topic will be covered in the next section.
