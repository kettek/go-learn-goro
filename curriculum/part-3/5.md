# Tunneling
We must now return to our **mapping/gamemap.go** file and add the capability to tunnel between rooms.

## Code Analysis
```
package mapping

+import (
+	"github.com/kettek/goro"
+)
+
```
We will be using the goro library for its `MinInt(...)` and `MaxInt(...)` functions so we are adding it as an import here.

---
```
// CreateRoom creates a room from a provided rect.
func (g *GameMap) CreateRoom(r Rect) {
  . . .
}
+
+// CreateHTunnel creates a horizontal tunnel from x1 to/from x1 starting at y.
+func (g *GameMap) CreateHTunnel(x1, x2, y int) {
+	for x := goro.MinInt(x1, x2); x <= goro.MaxInt(x1, x2); x++ {
+		if g.InBounds(x, y) {
+			g.Tiles[x][y] = Tile{}
+		}
+	}
+}
```
Here we define the `CreateHTunnel(...)` method. This is responsible for creating a horizontal tunnel between two coordinates while maintaining the same vertical position.

We are using the `goro.MinInt(...)` and `goro.MaxInt(...)` helper functions to acquire the smaller of two numbers and the larger of two numbers. We do this to ensure that our `x` variable always starts at the lesser coordinate and travels to the greater coordinate, regardless of if `x1` is smaller or larger than `x2` or otherwise.

---
```
+
+// CreateVTunnel creates a vertical tunnel from y1 to/from y2 starting at x.
+func (g *GameMap) CreateVTunnel(y1, y2, x int) {
+	for y := goro.MinInt(y1, y2); y <= goro.MaxInt(y1, y2); y++ {
+		if g.InBounds(x, y) {
+			g.Tiles[x][y] = Tile{}
+		}
+	}
+}

// IsBlocked returns if the given coordinates are blocking movement.
func (g *GameMap) IsBlocked(x, y int) bool {
```
Here we define the `CreateVTunnel(...)` method. This is almost the same as the horizontal tunneling method but with the difference of changing the vertical position while maintaining the horizontal position.

---
```
// MakeMap populates our GameMap with rooms.
func (g *GameMap) MakeMap() {
	room1 := NewRect(20, 15, 10, 15)
	room2 := NewRect(35, 15, 10, 15)

	g.CreateRoom(room1)
	g.CreateRoom(room2)
+	g.CreateHTunnel(25, 40, 23)
}
```
Now we have added a call that will make a horizontal tunnel from inside of one room to the other.

If you rebuild the project now, you will see that the rooms are connected and you can travel between them! :)

## Topics Covered
Tunneling! Like the Dwarves we strive to be!

## What's Next
Up next is the larger task of generating an entire randomized dungeon!
