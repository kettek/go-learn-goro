# Using the FoV in main
Now we switch back to **main.go** to modify our code to use the field of view.

## Code Analysis
```
		maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize := 30, 6, 10

+		fovRadius := 10
+		fovRecompute := true

		colors := map[string]goro.Color{
			"darkWall":    goro.Color{R: 25, G: 25, B: 25, A: 255},
			"darkGround":  goro.Color{R: 100, G: 100, B: 100, A: 255},
+			"lightWall":   goro.Color{R: 50, G: 50, B: 50, A: 255},
+			"lightGround": goro.Color{R: 150, G: 150, B: 150, A: 255},
		}
```
Here we have added the *fovRadius* and *fovRecompute* variables. These represent how far our player will be able to see and whether or not the fov should be recomputed.

Additionally, we have added the *lightWall* and *lightGround* colors to our color map.

---
```
		gameMap.MakeMap(maxRooms, roomMinSize, roomMaxSize, player)

+		fovMap := InitializeFoV(&gameMap)
```
Here we have a new *fovMap* variable that contains a ready-to-use `fov.Map` object.

---
```
		for {
+
+			if fovRecompute {
+				RecomputeFoV(fovMap, player.X, player.Y, fovRadius, fov.Light{})
+			}
+
			// Draw screen.
			DrawAll(screen, entities, gameMap, fovMap, fovRecompute, colors)
-			DrawAll(screen, entities, gameMap, colors)
-			ClearAll(screen, entities)
+
+			fovRecompute = false
+
+			ClearAll(screen, entities)

			// Handle events.
			switch event := screen.WaitEvent().(type) {
			case goro.EventKey:
				switch action := handleKeyEvent(event).(type) {
				case ActionMove:
					if !gameMap.IsBlocked(player.X+action.X, player.Y+action.Y) {
						player.Move(action.X, action.Y)
+						fovRecompute = true
					}
```
Here we have added our FoV-related computations. At the beginning of our game loop, we recompute the FoV if `fovRecompute` is set to true. We have also adjusted our drawing operations to use the new `fovMap` and `fovRecompute` variables. We also have placed `fovRecompute = false` immediately after our `DrawAll` call.

Additionally, we set `fovRecompute` to true if the player has moved. This allows the field of view to be updated whenever the player moves.

If you rebuild your project now, you should see the FoV in action!

## Topics Covered
We have adjusted our main to project update and render with our FoV.

## What's Next
Although it is nice to have a field of view in action, the entire map and its entities are still visible. We will add some fog of war functionality to allow us to actually explore the dungeon.
