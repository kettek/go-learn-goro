# Rendering with Fog of War
We now move back to our **render.go** file so that we can adjust the drawing functions to account for fog of war.

## Code Analysis
```
func DrawAll(screen *goro.Screen, entities []*entity.Entity, gameMap mapping.GameMap, fovMap fov.Map, fovRecompute bool, colors map[string]goro.Color) {
	if fovRecompute {
		// Draw all the tiles in the game map.
		for x, column := range gameMap.Tiles {
			for y, tile := range column {
				visible := fovMap.Visible(x, y)

				if visible {
					if tile.BlockSight {
						screen.SetBackground(x, y, colors["lightWall"])
					} else {
						screen.SetBackground(x, y, colors["lightGround"])
					}
+					gameMap.SetExplored(x, y, true)
-				} else {
+				} else if gameMap.Explored(x, y) {
					if tile.BlockSight {
						screen.SetBackground(x, y, colors["darkWall"])
					} else {
						screen.SetBackground(x, y, colors["darkGround"])
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

	// Draw all the entities in the game map.
	for _, entity := range entities {
-		DrawEntity(screen, entity)
+		DrawEntity(screen, entity, fovMap)
	}
	screen.Flush()
}
```
Here we have made some minor adjustments to our visibility rendering logic. First off, if a given tile is visible, then we call `gameMap.SetExplored(...)` on that specific tile so it is marked as explored. We then only render our non-visible tiles if our game map reports it as such with `gameMap.Explored(...)`.

Additionally, we have changed our `DrawEntity(...)` call so as to reflect a necessary change for only rendering entities that are within our FoV. This is covered next.

```
// DrawEntity draws a given entity to the screen.
-func DrawEntity(screen *goro.Screen, e *entity.Entity) {
-	screen.DrawRune(e.X, e.Y, e.Rune, e.Style)
+func DrawEntity(screen *goro.Screen, e *entity.Entity, fovMap fov.Map) {
+	if fovMap.Visible(e.X, e.Y) {
	screen.DrawRune(e.X, e.Y, e.Rune, e.Style)
+	}
}
```
Here we have replaced our old DrawEntity function with a new one for handling the FoV. All we are doing here is drawing the rune if our fovMap reports that it is visible.

If you build and run at this point, your field of view should work and you should be able to explore your dungeon!

## Topics Covered
Here we have done some simple changes so that out of view tiles are only rendered if they have been explored.

## What's Next
And with this, part 4 is complete. We now move on to generating enemies and basic interactions!
