# Adjusting GameMap for Exploration
We are now going to enhance our GameMap type as stored in **mapping/gamemap.go** so that we can interact with our Tile's `explored` property.

## Code Analysis
```
// CreateVTunnel creates a vertical tunnel from y1 to/from y2 starting at x.
func (g *GameMap) CreateVTunnel(y1, y2, x int) {
 . . .
}

+// Explored returns if the tile at x by y has been explored.
+func (g *GameMap) Explored(x, y int) bool {
+	if g.InBounds(x, y) {
+		return g.Tiles[x][y].Flags&Explored != 0
+	}
+	return false
+}
+
```
Here we have added the Explored method. This simply returns if the `Explored` bitflag is set for a tile at the provided x and y coordinates. If it is out of bounds false is always returned.

---
```
+// SetExplored sets the explored state of the tile at x and y to the passed explored bool.
+func (g *GameMap) SetExplored(x, y int, explored bool) {
+  if g.InBounds(x, y) {
+    if explored {
+      g.Tiles[x][y].Flags = g.Tiles[x][y].Flags | Explored
+    } else {
+      g.Tiles[x][y].Flags = g.Tiles[x][y].Flags &^ Explored
+    }   
+  }
+}

// IsBlocked returns if the given coordinates are blocking.
func (g *GameMap) IsBlocked(x, y int) bool {
  . . .
}
```
Here we have a method for setting a given coordinate to be explored or not providing it is within the map's boundaries. Just as we use the bitwise **|** operator to join bits, we can use the bitwise **&^** operator to clear bits.

## Topics Covered
We have simply added a setter and getter for the Tile's Explored property.

## What's Next
Now we can move on to the final step in our FoV journey -- rendering with our exploration fog of war.
