# Adding Explored to Tiles
We now return to **mapping/tile.go** to enhance our Tile type slightly to allow fog of war.

## Code Analysis

```
// Tile represents the state of a given location in a GameMap.
type Tile struct {
	BlockMovement bool
	BlockSight    bool
+	Explored      bool
}
```
Here we are adding the `Explored` boolean property that will determine whether or not the Tile has been explored by the player or not.

## Topics Covered
Barely anything.

## What's Next
Adjusting our GameMap to use the `Explored` property!
