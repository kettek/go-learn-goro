# Adding Explored to Tiles
We now return to **mapping/tile.go** to enhance our Tile type slightly to allow fog of war.

## Code Analysis
```
// Our Tile's flags.
const (
	BlockMovement = 1 << iota
	BlockSight
+	Explored
)
```
Here we are adding the `Explored` bitflag that will determine whether or not the Tile has been explored by the player.

## Topics Covered
Barely anything.

## What's Next
Adjusting our GameMap to use the `Explored` flag!
