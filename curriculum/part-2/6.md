# Mapping: The GameMap
With our Tile type now in place, we can create a new file in our **mapping** directory called **gamemap.go**. This GameMap will hold the map structure and important functions for map generation.

## Code Analysis

```
package mapping
```
Here we are declaring our GameMap type to exist in our mapping package.

---
```
// GameMap is our map data type.
type GameMap struct {
	Width, Height int
	Tiles         [][]Tile
}
```
This is our `GameMap` type that contains the map's width, height, and two-dimensional slice of Tile types.

---
```
// Initialize initializes a GameMap's Tiles to match its Width and Height. It also sets up some coordinates to block movement and sight.
func (g *GameMap) Initialize() {
	g.Tiles = make([][]Tile, g.Width)

	for x := range g.Tiles {
		g.Tiles[x] = make([]Tile, g.Height)
	}
```
Here is our GameMap's `Initialize()` function that we use to create its two-dimensional slice of Tile types. We are first using golang's built-in [https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/13](make(...)) function to create a slice of slices of Tiles up to the map's width. After this we iterate over each column of `g.Tiles` and create a slice of Tiles within each up to the map's height.

---
```
	g.Tiles[30][22] = Tile{
		BlockMovement: true,
		BlockSight:    true,
	}
	g.Tiles[31][22] = Tile{
		BlockMovement: true,
		BlockSight:    true,
	}
	g.Tiles[32][22] = Tile{
		BlockMovement: true,
		BlockSight:    true,
	}
}
```
Now we are setting three tiles at **30x22**, **31x22**, and **32x22** to both block movement and sight. And, finally, we are closing the function with the curly brace on the last line.

---
```
// IsBlocked returns if the given coordinates are blocking movement.
func (g *GameMap) IsBlocked(x, y int) bool {
  // Always block if outside our GameMap's bounds.
  if x < 0 || x >= g.Width || y < 0 || y >= g.Height {
    return true
  }
	return g.Tiles[x][y].BlockMovement
}
```
`IsBlocked(...)` simply returns a boolean representing whether or not a given tile blocks movement. We are also checking if the requested coordinates are smaller than 0 or larger than our Width and Height, and if so, to return as if blocking.

## Topics Covered
We have created the `GameMap` type that uses our Tile type and will create few dummy tiles for testing.

## What's Next
Now we will move on to integrating the `GameMap` with our main program.
