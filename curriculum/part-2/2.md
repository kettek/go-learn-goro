# The Entity Type
Now we can move on to creating a generic Entity type that we will use for storing data such as position, rune, and style.

However, to begin with, let us create a new directory in our project directory called **entity** that will store our Entity type and any future entity-related code. Now create a new file in the **entity** directory called **entity.go** and fill it with the code to the right.

## Code Analysis

```
+package entity
+
+import (
+ "github.com/kettek/goro"
+
+	"myproject/interfaces"
+)
```
Here we are declaring our package to be **entity** rather than main since we will be importing this package for use in our main program. Additionally, we are importing goro for use, as we'll be using `goro.Style` within this file. We are also importing our **interfaces** package so we can properly use the Entity interface. Be sure to replace **myproject** with whatever you named your module in [../part-1/1](Part 1:1).

---
```
+// Entity is a type that represents an active entity in the world.
+type Entity struct {
+  x, y int
+  rune rune
+  style goro.Style
+}
```
Now we have our Entity type that contains the pertinent data for moving and rendering it.

---
```
+// NewEntity returns an interfaces.Entity to our underlying Entity type.
+func NewEntity(x int, y int, r rune, s goro.Style) interfaces.Entity {
+  return &Entity{
+    x:     x,
+    y:     y,
+    rune:  r,
+    style: s,
+  }
+}
```
`NewEntity(...)` is simply a helper function for constructing a new entity pointer and returning it as an interface.Entity. Instead of this, you could use write `interfaces.Entity{&Entity{...}}` wherever NewEntity would be used.

---
```
+// X returns the entity's X position.
+func (e *Entity) X() int {
+	return e.x
+}
+
+// SetX sets the entity's X position.
+func (e *Entity) SetX(x int) {
+	e.x = x
+}
+
+// Y returns the entity's Y position.
+func (e *Entity) Y() int {
+	return e.y
+}
+
+// SetY sets the entity's Y position.
+func (e *Entity) SetX(y int) {
+	e.y = y
+}
```
Here we have the getters and setters for our x and y entity properties. These are simply methods through which we can modify or access our Entity's underlying data.

---
```
+// Rune returns the entity's rune.
+func (e *Entity) Rune() rune {
+	return e.rune
+}
+
+// SetRune sets the entity's rune.
+func (e *Entity) SetRune(r rune) {
+	e.rune = r
+}
```
Here we have the getter and setter for our Entity's rune.

---
```
+// Style returns the entity's goro.Style.
+func (e *Entity) Style() goro.Style {
+	return e.style
+}
+
+// SetStyle sets the entity's goro.Style.
+func (e *Entity) SetStyle(s goro.Style) {
+	e.style = s
+}
```
And finally we have our Style getter and setter.

---
```
+// Move moves the entity by a given amount.
+func (e *Entity) Move(x, y int) {
+  e.x += x
+  e.y += y
+}
```
This is a move method for an Entity that will change its X and Y values by adding the provided x and y parameters to them.

## Topics Covered
Here we have created our Entity type that fully implements our Entity interface.

## What's Next
With this, we can now actually use our Entity interface and type in our main program file.
