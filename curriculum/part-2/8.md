# Using our GameMap
Now we can move on to updating our main program to use our GameMap. Please note that we have yet to update our rendering to reflect the changes here, so rebuilding should be reserved for the end of the next lesson.

## Code Analysis

```
import (
	"github.com/kettek/goro"
	"log"

	"myproject/entity"
	"myproject/interfaces"
+	"myproject/mapping"
)
```
Here we update our imports to include our new mapping package that GameMap resides within. Ensure that you replace **myproject** with whatever you named your module in [../part-1/1](Part 1:1).

---
```
		// Our initial variables.
+		mapWidth, mapHeight := 80, 24
+
+		colors := map[string]goro.Color{
+			"darkWall":   goro.Color{R: 0, G: 0, B: 100, A: 255},
+			"darkGround": goro.Color{R: 50, G: 50, B: 150, A: 255},
+		}
+
+		gameMap := mapping.GameMap{
+			Width:  mapWidth,
+			Height: mapHeight,
+		}
+
+		gameMap.Initialize()
+
		player := entity.NewEntity(screen.Columns/2, screen.Rows/2, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorWhite})

```
Here we are adding quite a few things. The first is defining `mapWidth` and `mapHeight` variables. We are then defining a string [map](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/19) to map color names to `goro.Color` types. After this, we create a `gameMap` variable with its Width and Height set to our earlier mapWidth and mapHeight variables. After this, we then call the gameMap's `Initialize()` method to ensure all data structures are set up properly.

---
```
			// Draw screen.
-			DrawAll(screen, entities)
+			DrawAll(screen, entities, gameMap, colors)
			ClearAll(screen, entities)
```
Here we are updating our `DrawAll` function to reflect a change we have yet to make. This change passes both the gameMap and our map of colors we created earlier.

---
```
				case ActionMove:
-					player.Move(action.X, action.Y)
+					if !gameMap.IsBlocked(player.X+action.X, player.Y+action.Y) {
+						player.Move(action.X, action.Y)
+					}
```
The final change we are making is to use the `GameMap.IsBlocked(...)` method we defined in the previous lesson. This will disallow the player from moving into an area that is considered to block movement.

**NOTE**: If you build at this point, it will fail. The next lesson will bring our rendering up to date with our changes here.

## Topics Covered
We have adjusted our main program to use our GameMap type as well as a new Color map.

## What's Next
Now we can update our rendering to match this file so we can actually render the GameMap and move our character around within it.
