# Mapping: The Tile
So as to ensure a degree of organization is maintained, we must first create a new directory within your project directory titled **mapping**. Within this directory, create a file titled **tile.go** and place the code to the right within it.

## Code Analysis

```
package mapping
```
Here we are using a different package name than "main". Just as we refer to any goro library by prepending "goro." to it, when referring to a `Tile` we will prepend "mapping.".


---
```
// Tile represents the state of a given location in a GameMap.
type Tile struct {
	BlockMovement bool
	BlockSight    bool
}
```
Here is our Tile type. We have two simple boolean values as properties here: **BlockMovement** for blocking entity movement and **BlockSight** for blocking field-of-view (once we get there).

## Topics Covered
We have created a new package for holding types and functions corresponding to mapping and we have also defined a very basic Tile type.

## What's Next
Now we can move to creating a `GameMap` type using our Tile type.
