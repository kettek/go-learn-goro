# Multiple Entities and Rendering
Now we can return to our **main.go** file and adjust it to use our new rendering functions.

## Code Analysis

```
import (
	"log"

	"github.com/kettek/goro"

	"myproject/entity"
+	"myproject/interfaces"
)
```
Here we have added our **interfaces** package to our imports so we can use it later.

```
		// Our initial variables.
		player := entity.NewEntity(screen.Columns/2, screen.Rows/2, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorWhite})
+		npc := entity.NewEntity(screen.Columns/2-5, screen.Rows/2, '@', goro.Style{Foreground: goro.ColorYellow})
+
+		entities := []interfaces.Entity{
+			player,
+			npc,
+		}
```
Here we begin by creating a new variable called `npc` that is almost the same as our `player` entity but differs in position and foreground color.

Next, we create the variable, `entities` that refers to a slice of Entity interfaces. We construct this slice in-place by populating it with our `player` and `npc` variables.

---
```
		for {
			// Draw screen.
-			screen.DrawRune(player.X(), player.Y(), player.Rune(), player.Style())
-			screen.Flush()
-			screen.DrawRune(player.X(), player.Y(), ' ', goro.Style{})
+			DrawAll(screen, entities)
+			ClearAll(screen, entities)
```
Now we remove our old calls to render the player to the screen and replace it with our newly created `DrawAll(...)` and `ClearAll(...)` functions.

At this point, if you rebuild the program and run it, you should see two @ symbols on the screen and be able to move around the one representing the player.

## Topics Covered
We have created a list of entities that we can pass around and are now using properly abstracted rendering calls.

## What's Next
Now we will shift gears a bit and get into creating the Tile type followed by a GameMap type.
