# The GameMap Interface
Just as we created our Entity interface, we must also create a GameMap interface. Within your **interfaces** directory create a new filed called **gamemap.go**.

## Code Analysis
```
+package interfaces
```
Here we define this file to also be a part of the interfaces package.

---
```
+// Our GameMap interface. This provides access to tile state and more.
+type GameMap interface {
+  Width() int
+  Height() int
+  IsBlocked(x, y int) bool
+}
```
Here we have our fairly simply GameMap's methods.

## Topics Covered
Just our GameMap interface definition!

## What's Next
Implementing a GameMap struct!
