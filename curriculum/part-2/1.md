# The Entity Interface
We begin defining our Entity type by first creating an interface. Create a new directory in your project root called **interfaces**. Within this directory, create a new file called **entity.go**.

The interface we create will be the data type through which we access our concrete Entity types underneath. This gives us the ability to extend the functionality of an Entity beyond a single implementation of it.

## Code Analysis
```
+package interfaces
```
We define our new **Entity** interface to be part of the interfaces package.

---
```
import (
	"github.com/kettek/goro"
)
```
We must also import the goro library so we have access to **goro.Style**.

---
```
type Entity interface {
	// Basic property accessors
	X() int
	SetX(int)
	Y() int
	SetY(int)
	Rune(rune)
	SetRune(rune)
	Style() goro.Style
	SetStyle(goro.Style)
	// More complex methods
  Move(int, int)
}
```
Here we have our Entity interface definition. We are defining setters and getters(accessors) for the Entity's x, y, rune, and style properties. We are also defining the `Move(int, int)` method that we will be using to adjust our Entity's position by a given amount.

## Topics Covered
Implementing a basic Entity interface that we will later use.

## What's Next
Now we can move on to defining a concrete Entity type that implements our Entity interface.
