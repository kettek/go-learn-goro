# The Generic Entity
Now we can move on to creating a generic Entity type that we will use for storing data such as position, rune, and style.

However, to begin with, let us create a new directory in our project directory called **entity** that will store our Entity type and any future entity-related code. Now create a new file in the **entity** directory called **entity.go** and fill it with the code to the right.

## Code Analysis

```
package entity

import (
  "github.com/kettek/goro"
)
```
Here we are declaring our package to be **entity** rather than main since we will be importing this package for use in our main program. Additionally, we are importing goro goro for use, as we'll be using `goro.Style` within this file.

---
```
// Entity is a type that represents an active entity in the world.
type Entity struct {
  X, Y int
  Rune rune
  Style goro.Style
}
```
Now we have our Entity type that contains the pertinent data for moving and rendering it.

---
```
// Move moves the entity by a given amount.
func (e *Entity) Move(x, y int) {
  b.X += x
  b.Y += y
}
```
This is a move method for an Entity that will change its X and Y values by adding the provided x and y parameters to them.

---
```
// NewEntity returns a pointer to a newly created Entity.
func NewEntity(x int, y int, r rune, s goro.Style) *Entity {
  return &Entity{
    X:     x,
    Y:     y,
    Rune:  r,
    Style: s,
  }
}
```
`NewEntity(...)` is simply a helper function for constructing a new entity. Instead of this, you could use write the `&Entity{...}` code itself wherever NewEntity would be used.

## Topics Covered
Here we have simply created the Entity type and defined a single method and a utility function for creating it.

## What's Next
With this, we can now actually use our Entity type in our main program file.
